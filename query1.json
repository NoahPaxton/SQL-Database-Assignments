VisitScotland has worked in partnership with Sail Scotland over a number of years to assist in the development of this tourism market and has provided funds to support their marketing and research activity. The most recent research study was carried out at the London Boat Show in 2004 to gain more knowledge about the needs of sailing tourists. This showed a high propensity for existing sailing tourists to return to Scotland. The findings of this study has helped shape VisitScotland’s marketing strategy, which aims at making the most of Scotland’s coastlines and inland water ways for all types of maritime activities. This includes the development of the “SeaScotland” website, a year long campaign for 2005 featuring a comprehensive list of maritime related events, which aims to encourage visitors to make the most of Scotland’s coastlines and inland waterways for all types of activities from boat festivals to maritime exhibitions.</p> ",
