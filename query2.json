  "AnswerText": "This is an operational matterand therefore primarily for NHS Lothian. I understand from the board that the publicelectricity supply to the hospital was interrupted for a few seconds around midnight on 6 to 7 January.This led to some parts of the hospital being without mains power for periods ofup to 1 hour 50 minutes. I am told, however, that risk evaluation took place onan on-going basis during this time, and no patients were placed at risk.</p><p>Standby power systems came intooperation during the period. These systems ensured that most parts of the hospitalcontinued to function normally. However, some aspects of the standby system didnot function as expected. But the NHS board reports that there was no additionalrisk to patients, and in particular no threat to patients’ lives. </p><p>Clearly there are lessons tobe learned from what has happened. I expect that the board will consider carefullywhat further steps need to be taken with their contractors to reduce the impactof any future mains power interruption on the operation of the hospital.</p>",

It was hoped that the market could deliver 1,200 surveys.</p><p>We believe that the rationale for the single survey remains strong, providing in-depth information on property condition to both sellers and potential buyers. But as only 74 surveys have been commissioned it is clear that the potential marketing advantages do not provide sufficient incentives for house sellers to take part.

  "AnswerText": "The pilot hadtwo aims - to test the ability of the market to deliver the single survey on a voluntarybasis, and to test the concept itself. It is clear from the low take-up that themarket-led approach has not delivered and that the scheme does not provide enoughincentives for many sellers to participate on a voluntary basis.<b> </b>We believe, however, that the rationale for the singlesurvey remains strong – providing in-depth information on a property to buyer andseller before sale and ending the need for multiple condition surveys. We thereforeconcluded that we should now evaluate the detailed outcomes of the pilot with aview to introducing a mandatory scheme.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "As set out in the National Strategy, <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership</i>, it is for local drug action teams and constituent partners to plan and deliver the full range of drug treatment and care services in line with identified need and local priorities, and to spend available resources accordingly. Whilst it is not for the Executive to direct local plans, nor to make a judgement on whether or not there are “sufficient” crisis beds, or any other specific intervention in an area, a key element of the action plan published in the <i>Summary and Actions of the Drug Treatment and RehabilitationReview is to widen and improve the range of interventions available locally, toimprov</i>e outcomes for drug misusers. In support of this an additional £6 million per annum has been identified to develop and enhance a full range of drug treatment and rehabilitation services from 2005-06 to 2007-08.</p>",

This package is designed to provide a level of Executive funding which, together with a contribution from council tax income, will not only maintain existing levels of service but provide growth in key areas like care in the community and roads maintenance. The council tax contribution assumes increases of around only 2.5% in both 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p><p>In making my statement, I did acknowledge that the 2007-08 package is perceived by some to be tight but I will continue the dialogue with COSLA and individual local authorities on the matter of the 2007-08 funding package and this dialogue will be undertaken in the context of the overall Scottish budget and local government’s progress in implementing the Scottish Executive’s efficient government plan that expects overall savings from local government of £325 million.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive  what role social capital plays in social inclusion and what impact any such role has on the role of the state in social inclusion.",
  "AnswerText": "The concept of social capital continues to be the subject of active debate. Leading social scientists such as Putman define it in general terms as relating to “connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trust that arise from them”. Expressed in this way, claims have been made that social capital is influential in explaining a wide range of factors in society including educational performance, performance in the labour market, and civic participation, all of which relate to social inclusion.</p><p>Yet the mechanisms by which social capital may operate to produce these effects is far from clear. Progress is being made in research to put the concept onto a more rigorous footing, for example to identify categories of social capital and to understand the significance of formal and informal networks and local and wider processes of social attachment, for different social groups in the community. Until this is clearer it is not possible to properly assess the role of the state in promoting social capital  as a mechanism for increasing social inclusion.</p><p>Researchers in the Scottish Executive are actively engaged with those developing the knowledge base in this important area.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 received Royal Assent on 26 July 2004. Many of the measures came into force on 28 October, including antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) for under 16s, dispersal of groups and closure of premises. Other measures have either come into force since then, such as the ban on sales of spray paint to under 16s (5 November 2004) and fixed penalty notices for noise offences (28 February 2005) or will come into force in the coming months. Parenting orders and restriction of liberty orders for under 16s will become available in April, while commencement of antisocial behaviour notices is planned for November 2005.</p><p>Information on use of the measures in the act will be collected and published on a regular basis as part of the monitoring and evaluation of the act.  To end February 2005, there have been no antisocial behaviour orders made in respect of persons under 16 and the dispersal power has not yet been used, although we understand forces are planning to do so. The first closure order was made on 21 January 2005 and we know that at least three closure orders have been made to date.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Executive does not specifically provide support to the British Red Cross for the provision of disability equipment. The Scottish Executive provides considerable financial support to the voluntary sector in Scotland through a variety of direct and indirect grant schemes – over £400 million in 2004-05. The British Red Cross can therefore seek funding from one or more of these schemes providing the activities for which grant is sought promote Scottish Executive objectives. Each scheme has its own, specific eligibility criteria and details about them are provided in our guide for the voluntary sector to Scottish Executive grants, which can be found at:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/social/gvsg-00.asp\">www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/social/gvsg-00.asp</a>.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what investigations and qualitative research have been, and will be, conducted into the standard and quality of life for women who leave prison and what measures it has taken to improve this quality of life.",
  "AnswerText": "The Reports <i>A Safer Way</i> and <i>A Better Way</i> on women offenders, based on the evidence from research, highlighted the need to tackle the root causes which lead women to offend, rather than sentencing them repeatedly to short periods in custody. This work confirmed that the backgrounds of women in custody are marked by experience of abuse, drug misuse, poor education and employability prospects, unsuitable accommodation, poverty, debt and psychological distress. In response the Executive is co-ordinating work with key agencies to improve the standard and quality of life for women on their release. This is consistent with the more integrated approach to the management of offenders set out in the Criminal Justice Plan, published in December.</p><p>As well as providing a range of community sentences as alternatives to the unnecessary use of short custodial sentences, the Executive’s new enhanced throughcare strategy specifically targets vulnerable women serving short sentences for voluntary aftercare, particularly those with addictions problems.  Where women serve short sentences, this work seeks to link them back to services in the community, on their release.</p><p>The 218 Time Out Centre for women in Glasgow also offers a throughcare service to ex-prisoners including assistance in dealing with their social, economic and emotional problems.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Since 2003 the Gourock-Dunoonroute has been treated separately from the rest of the CalMac network in relationto the tendering proposals for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. This reflects the presence of along-established unsubsidised commercial operator on an adjacent Gourock toDunoon route. A prior information notice was recently issued in relation to theopportunity for a commercial service with no operating or timetablerestrictions.</p><p>The prior information noticewas not the start of a tender process. Rather, it was the first step inascertaining if there might be operators interested in providing a service fromDunoon Pier to Gourock Pier on a non-subsidised basis. This option was proposedin response to local analysis suggestingthat the Gourock-Dunoon service could beoperated on a commercial basis (without subsidy) if the service were to be allowedto operate without the time and frequency restrictions that have been imposed onCalMac’s vehicle service for many years. These two factors – an unsubsidisedcommercial competitor and analysis suggesting the possibility of a commercialservice – are not present on other Clyde and Hebrides routes. The other CalMac routes which are within theundertaking have been assessed as being loss making and so there are no plansto apply the approach suggested for Gourock–Dunoon to other routes.</p><p>The Gourock–Dunoon proposalswill not be taken any further forward until there have been further discussionsbetween the Executive and the European Commission and I have reported back toParliament.</p>",

Alternative analgesics to diamorphine are availableand care is needed when switching from one opioid analgesic to another to ensureequipotent dosage. The advice which issued from the department included a dosageguidance table.</p><p>In June 2000, the Scottish IntercollegiateGuidelines Network (SIGN) issued a guideline on the control of pain in patientswith cancer. This guideline, number 44, can be accessed at <ahref=\"http://www.sign.ac.uk/\">www.sign.ac.uk</a>.</p><p>The British National Formulary(BNF), issued free to doctors, gives advice on prescribing in palliative care.

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive  what discussions it has had, and with whom, regarding changing NHS consultant pension arrangements.",
  "AnswerText": "Demographic change, such as increasing longevity, has lead to a substantial increase in the cost of providing pensions in the public services. In order to combat the increasing costs, and in line with the UK Government policy on public service pensions, the NHS pension scheme is currently under review. The review is being carried out on the basis that the normal pension age for the scheme will increase to 65.</p><p>The main aim of the review is to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the scheme, while ensuring that it continues to provide security and value for money for both NHS employees and employers and meets the needs of a modern and diverse workforce in NHS Scotland.</p><p>New pension arrangements, including the increase in normal pension age, will apply to all new staff joining the NHS from 2006. Existing staff will not be affected till at least 2013, with all benefits earned to that date fully protected.</p><p>Responsibility for the review lies with the Scottish NHS HR Forum (HRF), which is a partnership between NHS employers and trade unions in Scotland and the Scottish Executive.</p><p>A full public consultation on the options for the future of the NHS scheme was launched on 24 January 2005, and will run till 25 April 2005. The consultation documents can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.sppa.gov.uk/\">www.sppa.gov.uk</a>. Copies have been placed inthe Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35022).</p><p>Decisions about the future of the NHS pension scheme in Scotland will be made following the conclusion of the consultation process.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Diabetes National Overview report concluded that the care of people with diabetes in Scotland is generally of a very high quality. It offered NHS boards constructive feedback on the strengths of their clinical management of diabetes and also highlighted areas for further development. </p><p>NHS boards now have an opportunity to address those areas in which more work is needed to meet the standards. Meanwhile, the data and information technology element of the standards are being addressed on a Scotland-wide basis. </p><p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will be invited to conduct a second series of review visits. These visits will focus on those criteria that were not met at the original visits. The final report of these visits is planned for publication in 2006.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what guidance it will issue to NHS boards to ensure that patients in danger of developing diabetes-related complications are timeously referred for appropriate specialist treatment.",
  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Executive has a role in ensuring that guidance, once agreed, is implemented but does not set guidance itself. The main source of guidance in Scotland is NHS Quality Improvement Scotland which also has responsibility for the Scottish Inter-Collegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and SIGN are independent bodies that set their own agenda for developing guidance.</p><p>The Scottish Executive has established Managed Clinical Networks (MCN) for diabetes services in each of the 15 NHS board areas. These MCNs bring together clinicians, patients and carers across primary, secondary and tertiary care to plan and deliver services. The MCNs offer a framework for encouraging communication between specialists, including renal medicine specialists, eye specialists, heart specialists, and vascular surgery specialists, and other members of the diabetes care team.</p>",

In these circumstances a single-crewed unit may be used. Such cases should only arise in the most exceptional of circumstances.</p> <p>We have been monitoring the use of single-crewed responses in the North and West Division and I can advise that during February 2005 the number of emergency calls which received a single-crewed response was 16 out of 1,063 calls – a total of 1.5%.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The use of on-call by the Scottish Ambulance Service in the Highlands and elsewhere in Scotland is an operational matter for that organisation. The rates of pay, including the on-call payment, are negotiated and agreed each year under the service’s partnership arrangements. The rate applies when staff are providing out-of-hours cover by being available on-call, in most cases at home, to respond to emergency calls. Where they are tasked to respond to a call they receive their full hourly rate of pay for the duration of the incident and for each call-out they receive a minimum of two hours pay. These payments are additional to those made to staff for their contracted in-hours duties.</p>",

The SMC made a decision in December 2003 following independent review not to recommend this treatment for SRE in prostate cancer. It concluded that although zometa led to a reduction in SREs compared with placebo in these patients, the absolute reduction was small and there was not sufficient evidence to introduce zometa into standard practice for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. An economic case was submitted by the manufacturer but its quality was not judged to be sufficientto support a recommendation that the drug is cost-effective relative to standardpractice in Scotland for this particular indication.</p><p>The Scottish Executive does not intend to give further guidance on this issue.</p>",

This service has been provided by some local health councils in thepast and some NHS boards have provided funding for complaints support staff. Thereare currently no national standards for the delivery of complaints advice and supportand it is outwith the health council core remit. Arrangements are now being developedto establish a partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland and their local bureauxto formalise their existing arrangements for providing advice and support on NHSservices.</p><p>The Scottish Health Council willnot provide advice and support services, but they will seek to ensure that NHSboards have appropriate and effective arrangements in place. The Scottish HealthCouncil will also ensure that individual patients, carers and members of the publicare able to make their views on health services known.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive  whether confidential information has been, or is being, shredded by it or any Executive agency in order to avoid disclosure under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and, if so, why.",
  "AnswerText": "No. It would be wholly unacceptable for information to be destroyed simply to avoid disclosure under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act or in any other way to evade the obligations of accountability or transparency.</p><p>Around 98% of records held by the Scottish Executive and its agencies are destroyed in regular file reviews as laid down in records management guidance. Such guidance is generally subject to approval by the Keeper of the Records of Scotland, and is made available to staff and on the Executive's and many agencies' websites. Records are retained so long as they serve one or more of three broad purposes: because they are of immediate business use; because they must be kept in compliance with law or regulation; or, for a very small proportion, because they are expected to be of historical value to future generations, including historians. It is not the practice of the Executiveor of any agency, and in some cases would be against the law, to destroy information, confidential or not, for any other reason than that it has reached the end of its life according to these criteria. Information is thus being destroyed all the time, but not for the reasons supposed in the question.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Projects delivered under the joint venture arrangement will be supported through public capital enabling funds which will facilitate site purchase, demolition and clearance costs as well as addressing negative equity concerns of GPs. The underlying principle of LIFT is that a LIFT Company requires to pay market value for any property transferred to it and therefore such enabling funds will return to the public sector for reinvestment in services. There is therefore no subsidy.</p> <p>Given LIFT is a public private joint venture model, any financial gain made on the development of a particular site would be shared between shareholders including the public profit.</p><p>However, throughout the life of the project the Scottish Executive will not subsidise directly any Joint Venture. As with any other PPP/PFI project, a Joint Venture would go ahead only on the basis of an approved business case which would have to demonstrate affordability and value for money. </p><p>Standard contract documentation prepared for the NHS LIFT development in England includes provisions that ensure the LIFT company provides services at its own risk and there is no recourse to public funds beyond the initial investment made by public sector partners. Any development of a LIFT type model in Scotland would apply the same principles.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to concerns that victims of crimes such as vandalism, theft and breach of the peace will not consider themselves best served by the justice system if those accused and convicted of these crimes are issued with fixed penalty notices rather than summoned to court.",
  "AnswerText": "No person convicted of a crime will be offered a fixed penalty notice. We consider that fixed penalty notices, correctly and appropriately used, are an important part of a modern criminal justice system. They offer a quick, proportionate and effective response to minor offending so that an offender, and the community he or she is part of, are aware that such behaviour will not be tolerated.</p> <p>The use of fixed penalty notices for Antisocial behaviour will be exercised in line with guidelines from the Lord Advocate and the list of applicable offences will be kept under review. Vandalism and breach of the peace are amongst the list of fixed penalty offences at section 128 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004, but theft is not. A pilot scheme testing the use of these penalties commenced in Tayside on 1 April 2005.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Our policy is to support the development of a wide range of renewable technologies. Use of these technologies, including wind power, and where they replace fossil fuel generation, will help reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions .</p> <p>A report commissioned by the DTI from ILEX Consulting, in association with Professor Gorban Strbac from the University of Manchester, entitled “Quantifying The System Costs Of Additional Renewables In 2020”, found that any additional fossil fuel reserve capacity needed to balance an increase in intermittent renewables connecting to the grid would not be on a megawatt for megawatt basis. The reserve capacity will be less than the renewables capacity, meaning that overall emissions will be reduced. </p><p>Similarly, the <i>House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology Fourth Report (2004)</i> found that “the notion that wind power needs 100 percent back-up does not stand up to analysis” (Chapter 7, paragraph 5).

  "AnswerText": "<i>E.coli</i> O157 can be a serious infection and, in addition to causing gastroenteritis, is the most common cause of kidney failure in children in Scotland. Infections occur as either outbreaks, where a general outbreak is defined as involving members of more than one household or as sporadic cases where only 1 individual or household is affected with no apparent links to known outbreaks.</p> <p>Health Protection Scotland conducted a national case-control study of sporadic cases of <i>E.coli </i>O157 in Scotland from 1996 to 1999. This study found that contact with the faeces of animals found on farms or smallholdings emerged as the strongest single risk factor for <i>E.coli</i> O157 infection. This type of contact was most common amongst children aged four to seven.</p><p>Between 1996 and 2003, in cases where the source of infection could be established, Health Protection Scotland identified;</p><p>eight outbreaks of <i>E.coli</i> O157 located on farm premises, in which 20 children under 16 were infected.</p><p>An additional 40 children were infected with <i>E.coli</i> O157 after camping on ground used for pasture, which was contaminated with farm animal faeces.  </p><p>A further 11 children were infected with <i>E.coli</i> O157 in outbreaks where the evidence suggested that water supplies were contaminated by farm animal faeces. </p><p>In 1999, 29 children were infected with <i>E.coli</i> O157 infection in a single outbreak, after eating homemade goat’s milk cheese prepared on a smallholding.</p><p>In March 2005 the Scottish Executive launched a campaign to raise awareness of the risk of contracting <i>E.coli</i> O157 from animals/animal pasture and to advise of simple precautions which can be take to reduce this risk. </p><p>More information is available on the internet at <a href=\"http://www.handsclean.info/\">www.handsclean.info</a>.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p> <p>&quot;The challenge set for the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) and the SPS-Trade Union Side (TUS) has been to develop a robust and credible plan for the design, construction and management of a second new prison, most likely at the current Low Moss site. The proposals will need to show that the new public sector service is competitive, offers value for money, delivers all requirements and additional places on time and inspires confidence that the service can be delivered and sustained by both the SPS and TUS. The challenge will be to provide a modern and affordable public sector solution to the delivery of prison services.</p><p>The team have not yet concluded as to their solution and to speculate on the final outcomes of the joint SPS and TUS partnership’s work might lead to commercial disadvantage in developing a competitive in-house bid. We can, however, advise that it has been agreed by the partners that all SPS employees operating within the public sector prison, if successful, would be covered by the terms of the Civil Service Management Code.</p>",

On 5 March, the First Minister said in Dundee that the Executive was considering proposals to end the automatic early release without conditions of sex offenders on short sentences. A reference to this comment was included in the notes to editors of an Executive press release issued on 15 March to mark the signing of a Concordat to improve inter-agency working with sex offenders.</p><p>I have now written to the Sentencing Commission for Scotland, seeking their views on a range of options for changing the early release and post-release supervision arrangements for sex offenders. The options paper has been copied to the conveners of the Justice Committees and copies have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 36095).</p>",

  "AnswerText": "In 2000, the Chief Medical Officer issued advice to NHS boards on national criteria for access to NHS-funded assisted conception treatment, based on the recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS). The criteria included social as well as clinical criteria. They include a criterion that there should be “no child living with the couple in their home”<i>. </i>The consensus view of EAGISS (as supported by patient representatives) was that couples who already have a child in the home should be ineligible for NHS funded assisted conception treatment in order that a childless couple may have this opportunity. The criterion was re-considered at a consensus conference of EAGISS in 2003 when it was agreed it should continue to stand.</p> ",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what level of legal aid is available to individuals and communities wishing to bring cases against polluters.",
  "AnswerText": "Under the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, legal aid can be made available only to individuals not to community groups or communities. Cases against polluters may involve either civil or criminal action.</p> <p>Individuals and communities cannot bring criminal prosecutions. Criminal prosecutions can only be brought by Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service as it has the sole responsibility for instituting criminal prosecutions in Scotland. Prosecutions may arise from reports by outside organisations with statutory responsibility for matters in relation to pollution. Criminal legal aid may be available for any person who is the subject of such a prosecution.</p><p>Civil legal aid may be made available to an individual if the three statutory tests of financial eligibility, probable cause and reasonableness are met as is the case with any civil legal aid application. </p><p>Further statutory considerations apply to civil legal aid applications if there are others that have a joint interest in the proceedings. The Scottish Legal Aid Board can grant civil legal aid only if the refusal of legal aid would cause severe prejudice to the individual applicant and it would not be reasonable to expect others that might have an interest in the action to defray the costs that otherwise fall to be paid under the grant of civil legal aid.</p>",

All offenders are offered assistance in the form of “harm reduction” sessions at admission as part of the National Induction process. Dependent on sentence length additional supports may be accessed.</p><p>A local authority “in reach” service will replace the transitional care service, (Addictions Throughcare) up to six weeks before the offender leaves custody.

  "AnswerText": "I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p> <p>Heating bills may increase after installation of a new central heating system on the programme, but these increases must be viewed alongside the increase in heat and warmth in the property that a new central heating system affords. And, when a new central heating system is installed the property is eligible to receive all the available insulation measures from loft insulation, cavity fill, pipe and tank insulation, draughtproofing and low energy lightbulbs.</p><p>We would encourage recipients of assistance on the central heating programme, who are concerned about their fuel bills, to contact the Executive to discuss their concerns. They may also be advised to contact Energywatch to establish whether they are paying a competitive price for their fuel.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Executive is committed to playing its part in tackling global poverty and inequality. We will work in partnership with the UK Government and the international development sector in Scotland to this end. In March the First Minister launched the Scottish Executive’s international development strategy. This sets out the contribution that devolved government in Scotland can make, and the responsibilities we have, to developing countries. The Scottish programme is set within the context of the UK Government’s international development policy, which is rooted in the Millennium Development Goals, one of which is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.</p> <p>The key strands of the Scottish Executive’s policy are focussed on support for developing countries, especially through the development of non-governmental organisations in Scotland; assistance during times of international crises, and active consideration of the positive impact of our policies on the developing world. The policy is intended to focus on Scotland’s key strengths and values, facilitating the transfer of knowledge, skills, and expertise, to where they are needed most in the world. We have made available an international development fund of £3 million per annum to support work in this area.</p>",

Another SCRA Research report <i>Social Backgrounds of Children Referred to the Reporter</i> looked at the social background of 100 children’s files from Glasgow, Inverclyde and Aberdeenshire. That report found that within these files 39% demonstrated parental problem alcohol abuse, while 35%contained evidence of parental misuse of drugs.

However, it has never been the policy of this or any previous Government that every student accepted for a post-graduate course of study or research at higher education institutions should automatically receive support from public funds.</p><p>Support for courses at masters and doctorate level is also provided by the UK Research Councils, depending on field of study. All are independent bodies and the fact that a course lies within their remit does not oblige them to support all, or indeed any, students applying for awards.</p><p>Many students at this level obtain loans from banks, seek sponsorship, receive help from educational trusts or pursue their studies on a part-time basis.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The disposal of the MV Pioneer by Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Scottish Public Finance Manual, which states that “holdings of assets should be kept under constant review with a view to disposing of surplus assets as quickly as possible” and “the best possible price should be obtained for surplus assets. Assets should therefore normally be sold on the open market.”</p> <p>It is important to note that these instructions do not require that in all cases assets must be sold on the open market.</p><p>In this case, I understand that Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. obtained an independent valuation of the vessel last year and placed it in the hands of ship brokers for disposal. Following four expressions of interest and a firm offer to purchase the vessel, the CalMac Board took the collective decision to accept that offer, which was 22.2% in excess of the independent valuation that had been obtained. The board also took into account savings in lay up costs from an early disposal.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Data about injury road accidents are collected by the Police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the “Stats 19” statistical report forms.</p> <p>The Scottish Executive’s road accident statistics database is designed to provide information about the numbers of accidents and casualties for Scotland as a whole, for police force and local authority areas, and for the main roads. It is not designed to provide figures for short stretches of local roads. The statistical report forms do not include police forces’ detailed descriptions of accident locations, which can be used by local authorities to determine whether, for example, an accident which was reported as having taken place on the outskirts of a village actually occurred just outside it, or just within it. Subject to these caveats, the information held in the central statistical database suggests that there were two accidents involving personal injury on the B822 in Kippen in the years from 1994 to 2003 (inclusive): one in 1994 and one in 2002.</p><p>It should be noted that these statistics are based upon data which were collected by the police at the time of the accident, and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at a local level, about the location of each accident, based on its knowledge of the road and the area concerned.</p>",

The Housing (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced on 7 March, would require each local authority to set out in its local housing strategy a strategy for ensuring that it complies with this duty. </p><p>The Executive provides funding through Private Sector Housing Grant to local authorities to address condition issues in private sector housing.

This means that boards can determine, based on their local knowledge or the local needs of the local area how this money should be spent.

Within the total capital provision available over this period, £125 million has been specifically identified for the purchase/replacement of medical and diagnostic equipment. £40 million has been made available in the current year with a further £40 million and £45 million distributed in 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively. </p><p>To create better conditions for long term planning NHS boards have been notified of fixed formula allocations for the three year period 2005-06 to 2007-08. This has improved certainty for NHS boards and will allow for the allocation of budgets to budget holders earlier than otherwise would be the case. Capital delegated limits for NHS boards have also been increased from 1 April this year which will allow greater autonomy and will enable capital projects to be taken forward without seeking prior approval from the Health Department for all but the largest projects.</p>",

NHS boards are given general revenue and capital allocations and it is for the boards to decide, based on their local knowledge, of local needs, how these resources should be deployed.

  "AnswerText": "Pleasure craft-related tourism is very important to the economy of parts of Scotland. VisitScotland has worked in partnership with Sail Scotland over a number of years to assist in the development of this tourism market and has provided funds to support their marketing and research activity. The most recent research study was carried out at the London Boat Show in 2004 to gain more knowledge about the needs of sailing tourists. This showed a high propensity for existing sailing tourists to return to Scotland. The findings of this study has helped shape VisitScotland’s marketing strategy, which aims at making the most of Scotland’s coastlines and inland water ways for all types of maritime activities. This includes the development of the “SeaScotland” website, a year long campaign for 2005 featuring a comprehensive list of maritime related events, which aims to encourage visitors to make the most of Scotland’s coastlines and inland waterways for all types of activities from boat festivals to maritime exhibitions.</p> ",

The CDA will have an overarching enterprise focus to help in the promotion, creation and development of dynamic and sustainable co-operatives, and more generally to help maximise the contribution co-operatives can make to growing the Scottish economy. It will provide a means to promote the co-operative business model as a real alternative to other business structures and, at a practical level, it will deliver advice and information to new and growing co-operatives businesses – Scotland wide. The Executive will fund the new agency by allocating up to £3 million for this work over the next three years.</p> <p>The agency will be incorporated within the enterprise networks to ensure an appropriate level of integration with the broader business support structure. It will, however, have its own identity as a subsidiary company of the networks and operate with an advisory board, including representatives from the co-operative sector.</p><p>We have already started our detaiIed discussions with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the establishment of the CDA and we are keen to set the body up as quickly as possible.</p>",

His response is as follows:</p> <p>The EU Directive 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings is to be implemented in Scotland by the Scottish Building Standards Agency on behalf of Scottish ministers. The intention is to implement in 2006 but to make use of the derogations permitted by the Directive to phase in energy certification and the inspection of boilers and air-conditioning over three years. </p><p>In relation to energy performance certification, there are insufficient independent experts currently available for the system to be fully in place by January 2006 which is why implementation will be phased. In the interim, priority in Scotland will be given to the certification for display in public buildings, expected in 2006, and roll-out of certification for construction, sale and rental of other buildings which is expected in spring of 2007.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Chief Scientist’s Office (CSO) is currently funding three research projects relating to Crohn’s disease at a total cost of £334,000. Two of the projects, namely, “Gene-environmental interactions in inflammatory bowel disease” and “An investigation of the genetic determinants of susceptibility of Crohn's disease in the Scottish population” are being carried out at the University of Edinburgh. The third project, namely, “Magnetic Resonance Imaging of small bowel in Crohn's disease: evaluation of a novel orally administered hypersomolar bowel-distending agent” is being carried out at the University of Dundee.</p> <p>The CSO works closely with the Medical Research Council (MRC), the main agency through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research. It is an independent body deciding what research to support on its own expert judgement. In 2003-04, the MRC spent £1.4 million on research relevant to Crohn’s disease. This included a recently completed project entitled “Microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract” carried out at the University of Dundee.</p><p>Details of these projects can be found on the National Research Register (NRR), which is a database of on-going and recently completed publicly funded research projects. this can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.nrr.nhs.uk/search.htm\">www.nrr.nhs.uk/search.htm</a>. the nrr shows that in scotland, in addition to the projects already mentioned, there are a further three projects researching Crohn’s disease taking place at the University of Edinburgh.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 made a number of changes to the rules governing who can stand for election as a councillor. Section 7 lifts the requirement for council employees to resign upon nomination as a candidate but replaces it with a requirement to resign upon election. Section 8 reduces the age at which a person may stand for election as a councillor from 21 to 18. Both these sections came into force on 20 January 2005. Section 9 removes the salary threshold above which council employees are regarded as holding politically restricted posts and are therefore prevented from standing for election as a councillor. That section will be commenced at a suitable opportunity before the next local government elections.</p> ",

  "AnswerText": "We have achieved much in theprovision of health care for stroke patients since the publication of the CHDand Stroke Strategy in 2002. Fifteen separate Managed Clinical Networks (MCNs),for Stroke have been established – one in each NHS Board area.  Over the pastthree years the Scottish Executive has allocated an additional £40 million forCHD and stroke projects in Scotland, delivered through MCNs. Examples of stroke projectsinclude:</p><p>Providing or enhancing acutestroke units;</p><p>Improving access to CTimaging services;</p><p>Establishing neurovascularclinics;</p><p>Recruiting over 60 newspecialist nursing, AHP and medical staff;</p><p>Setting up a Stroke Audit toenable the storage and use of reliable data on Scottish stroke patients </p><p>Since 1995 there has been a34% drop in mortality from stroke, and the survival rate of patients 30 daysafter suffering a stroke has increased by 14% in the same period.  The capacityof MCNs to bring together staff from many different sectors (medical, nursing,therapeutic) to work in a co-ordinated way for the benefit of patients hascontributed significantly to these improvements.</p><p>More detail on improvementin stroke services can be found in the CHD/Stroke Strategy Update at: www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/30859/0012660.pdf.</p>",

There is no agreed standard for the amount, frequency or length of physiotherapy follow-up for stroke patients. However, guidelines produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network specify that all patients who have difficulties with movement following a stroke should have access to a physiotherapist specialising in stroke.

  "AnswerText": "The core work on the previous Northern Isles ferry tendering process (which culminated in an award of contract to NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Limited in December 2000) was carried out by a team based in the Transport Group of what is now the Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department. However, inputs to the work were made by senior officials in Transport Group and by staff in a range of policy and professional divisions across the Scottish Office/Scottish Executive. It is not possible to quantify the staff costs incurred on this work by such officials as work on the tendering exercise represented only one element of their duties. On similar grounds, it is not possible to cost the ministerial involvement in the process. However, on the basis of the staff costs of the core team (without any allowance for general Scottish Office/Scottish Executive overheads relating, for example, to accommodation costs), it is estimated that a total of £100,000 (in outturn prices) was spent on the exercise broken down as follows: </p> <p>Staffing - £86,000</p><p>Travel and Subsistence Expenses for Officials - £ 1,000</p><p>External Advice - £13,000.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Approximately £18 million willbe raised to fund the Scottish Beef Calf Scheme. The scheme is in its first yearand the administrative costs will be largely dependent on the number and complexityof claims submitted: costs of £0.5 million are currently anticipated. Administrationcosts are met from the administration budget of the Scottish Executive and not from the monies raised from the Single Farm Payment. The whole sumraised will be paid to farmers and the payments will be modulated as are all PillarI payments. Actual payments will depend onthe numbers of animals claimed but are estimated at £70 per head for the first 10eligible calves and £35 per head for each subsequent eligible calf.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the statement made by the UK Government in its response to the European Commission's Green Paper on Services of General Interest of May 2003, that the proposed model of splitting Caledonian MacBrayne into an infrastructure-owning company and an operating company creates \"an artificial barrier\" that \"distances the development of the fleet from its operation\".",
  "AnswerText": "The UK Government’s response reflected the Scottish Executive’s position at that time in relation to the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. Given the constraints that European law imposes, this does not detract from the Executive view that the best way to tender the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services is through the establishment of a publicly-owned vessel and harbour owning company. This will ensure that the assets are retained in public ownership and made available on a long-term basis to the operator of the services.</p> ",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-17992 by Mr Andy Kerr on 15 August 2005, what monitoring of mandatory trawl procedures it undertakes.",
  "AnswerText": "In return for the operational independence holding bodies now have in respect of property transactions, they are monitored on their implementation of the procedures contained in the NHSScotland Property Transactions Handbook. The Scottish Executive does not undertake any monitoring of individual transactions including, for example, compliance with mandatory trawl procedures as this is a function of the audit process conducted within each holding body.</p> <p>Audit Committees are responsible for the oversight of the internal audit programme and are responsible for reporting to health boards.</p><p>NHSScotland holding bodies are required to submit to the department annual monitoring reports which provide an overview of each holding body’s performance in managing property transactions completed that year and which highlight instances where the procedures detailed in the Property Transactions Handbook have not been followed. This would include instances where trawl procedures have not been undertaken in accordance with the handbook and if appropriate actions have not been agreed between the internal auditor and the board to remedy such a situation then the department would intercede to ensure that procedures are put in place to ensure compliance with the Property Transactions Handbook.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "I have asked Gillian Thompson, Chief Executive of Accountant in Bankruptcy to respond. Her response is as follows</p> <p>As part of the transitional arrangements to transfer work, the agency has a planned programme of reducing staff numbers. At present, the programme allows for an office in Edinburgh for the next 18 months. During September the staff numbers located in Edinburgh will reduce to 48. In addition to the 25 staff (reduced from 27) dealing with case enquiries there are 13 staff providing essential support services to colleagues in Ayrshire, in areas such as Finance and IT and a further 10 staff working on a major IT project replacing the Agency’s case management system, which is due for completion in early 2006. The number of staff in Edinburgh is under regular review and it may be possible to close the office more quickly, but that depends on the success of the work transfer. Currently the transfer is progressing at an appropriate rate, bearing in mind the technical nature of the work.</p><p>Staff costs in relation to the Edinburgh office are £109,000 per month but these will decrease in line with the reduction of staff as work is transferred to Ayrshire. In addition rent, rates and other overheads are running at £11,000 per month.</p><p>For the financial year 2004-05 the cost of the relocation process was £1.25 million. For the current financial year, the cost is estimated to be £2.9 million. In the event that it proves possible to close the Edinburgh office earlier than currently planned then this cost will be less. The cost of the initial feasibility study was £11,000.</p><p>Training of new staff also impacts on the transfer of work strategy. The training plan covered both the technical and personal development of staff with some 50 training sessions, averaging two days per session, having been delivered by in-house trainers between November 2004 and March 2005. As the sessions were delivered by in-house staff there were no additional real costs incurred, however the input in staff time is estimated to be £20,000. In addition the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) delivered in-depth technical training over three two-day sessions at a cost of £12,000.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18195 by Tavish Scott on 24 August 2005, why the system of support for ferry services to the Northern Isles was changed in 1998 from a tariff rebate subsidy to a block grant payment.",
  "AnswerText": "In 1993, the then Scottish Office commissioned a Shipping Subsidies Review to find a longer term solution to the financial viability of ferry services to Orkney and Shetland. That review concluded that Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS), the mechanism then used to support P&amp;O Scottish Ferries’ Northern Isles operations, was no longer an adequate subsidy system for the support of shipping.  The main reasons were that: TRS failed to provide for the replacement of vessels, as it could not guarantee the profitability required for such major investments or the security needed to attract a long-term commitment to the routes; TRS encouraged excess capacity and competition, particularly from freight-only competitors, that depressed profitability, threatening the long-term viability of all shipping operations; TRS could not compensate for any fall in traffic revenues, and, as PO Scottish Ferries’ revenues from freight carryings fell due to competition, so did its overall profitability to the point that it was no longer commercially viable.</p> <p>The Shipping Subsidies Review Report recommended that The Scottish Office should introduce new arrangements based on a block grant set to reflect estimated volumes, revenues and costs.  Scottish Office Ministers announced in October 1994 their decision to award a block grant for the period 1997-2002 and an open competitive tendering exercise began in June 1995. Three bids were received and after thorough consideration, Scottish Office Ministers concluded that the bid from P&amp;O Scottish Ferries offered the best value for money. Scottish Office Ministers subsequently agreed that P&amp;O Scottish Ferries should be paid a basic annual block grant, subject to clawback arrangements should the company’s profits exceed forecasts.</p>",

Money will also be made available to ensure that our proposed reforms to the summary justice system (set out in “Smarter Justice, Safer Communities – Summary Justice Reform, Next Steps”) are realised, leading to faster and more efficient handling of less serious cases.” </p> <p>The total cost of funding Community Justice Authorities will depend on the number of such authorities which is currently subject to discussion with local authorities. The costs of a single Community Justice Authority are also likely to depend on their boundaries. We expect that the number of Community Justice Authorities will represent a reduction from the current 14 Criminal Justice Social Work Groupings/Unitary Authorities. The estimated annual cost of a single Community Justice Authority is around £200,000.</p>",

Livestock transported from Orkney are housed in Goods and Livestock Transporters which give the animals considerably more space than livestock vehicles and the road journey from Aberdeen is likely to be considerably shorter than that from Caithness. There is no evidence to suggest that sea journeys are particularly stressful and it is generally recognised that the most stressful time for animals is during loading and unloading. Provided those involved in the transport of animals comply with the requirements of the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, animal welfare problems should not arise during sea transport.</p> ",

We have commissioned a Scottish Planning Assessment to consider where the demand for rail services is likely to grow over the next 10 to 20 years, and to identify where the rail network may be unable to meet this demand. We are issuing a consultation asking for views on what the strategic priorities for rail should be.

  "AnswerText": "The training of doctors is a continuous process from medical school graduation through the training grades to consultant or general practitioner level. To make the most appropriate use of the training capacity in NHSScotland the number of opportunities across the medical training grades must be broadly in balance with each other and ultimately aligned to meet the service needs for consultants and general practitioners.</p> <p>Workforce planning determines the number of training places in Scotland required both for the longer term and for the immediate transition to new training arrangements under the initiative <i>Modernising Medical Careers (MMC.) </i>The aim is to ensure that those doctors currently in the system in Scotland have every opportunity to remain here. In determining the detailed transitional arrangements for MMC, we are therefore considering Scotland’s current pool of junior doctors to ensure that these arrangements make best use of the range of selection options which may be available, both for the training posts we have/need and the junior doctors who currently occupy them. Transitional arrangements are critical to avoid gaps in the medical workforce, future medical shortages and also over supply of trainee doctors in relation to available posts.</p><p>The fundamental reform of postgraduate medical training, <i>Modernising Medical Careers,</i> has now commenced on a UK-wide basis. New two-year Foundation Programme appointments for graduates have been introduced and will be followed by specialty training programmes to train doctors to a level where they are eligible for appointment as a consultant or general practitioner.</p>",

The redacted documents will be deposited with the National Archives of Scotland this week and will be available for inspection by members of the public from Monday 3 October 2005.</p><p>The editing involved the removal from the documents the names of living individuals and replacing with individual designations, such as “Witness 1” or “Child A” to preserve anonymity but ensure that the edited documents would still make sense to any reader. The process of simply removing an individual’s name, in some documents, did not preserve anonymity. It was also considered that some of the documents contained distressing information about the victims and it is therefore not possible for each and every document to be released, even in an edited manner. The Closure Order in respect of files one to four will therefore remain in place for the specified period of 100 years. Files one to four contain profiles, photographs, medical reports and post mortem reports of the injured and deceased respectively. All of the other documents, in their redacted format, will be made available to the public.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "In general, the development of such coastal shipping services is a commercial matter for shipping operators to consider. We do, however, have a role in circumstances where financial support is necessary to maintain essential lifeline services to island communities, which is why we are currently re-tendering the Northern Isles ferry contract and tendering for a new Northern Isles lift-on lift-off freight contract.</p> <p>We have had no discussions with any shipping operators about shipping services from Scotland to Iceland or the Faroes.</p><p>New and improved ferry links to Europe have the potential to increase trade and tourism and take lorry traffic off busy Scottish routes. However, such services must prove commercially viable if they are to succeed as our ability to offer financial support is limited. We shall be considering all possible means of encouraging new developments, in line with our Partnership Agreement commitment to improve ferry links to Europe, including the possibility of Freight Facilities Grant or the Waterborne Freight Grant, where a new service would reduce lorry miles.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-32237 by Lewis Macdonald on 16 December 2002, what the latest figures available are for the percentage of commercial vehicles and HGVs that use the A9 trunk road between Perth and Inverness and how these figures compare with the national average for non-dual carriageway trunk roads.",
  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Traffic Database has two automatic classifier sites on the A9 between Perth and Inverness at Birnam and Tomatin. The percentage of heavy goods vehicles at these sites is 13% and 19% respectively, based on data from all of 2004.</p> <p>In addition, surveys of short duration were undertaken at 10 sites between Perth and Bruar in 2004. The percentage of heavy goods vehicles found in these surveys was between 10% south of Luncarty and 19% north of Bruar.</p><p>Information on the national average percentages of heavy goods vehicles on non-dual carriageway trunk roads is not currently published. However, a broad analysis of the information in the Scottish Roads Traffic Database suggests that the average figure is around 15% for single carriageway trunk roads in Scotland.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Statins are available to patients on NHS prescription. These medicines are widely prescribed and, as with all medicines, the decision whether or not to prescribe a drug is a matter for the clinician concerned, in discussion with the patient.</p> <p>Over the past five years, prescribing of these drugs in Scotland has more than doubled from 1.299 million items in 2000-01 to 3.025 million items in 2004-05. These figures reflect prescribed items dispensed in the community and do not take into account medicines dispensed through the hospital service.</p><p>The quality indicators in the new General Medical Services contract include cholesterol management for patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Indicator sets are designed to encourage more structured care of patients with chronic diseases.<b> </b></p><p>Since July 2004, Simvastatin 10mg has been available for purchase from community pharmacists without a prescription. The decision to allow a statin to be available without a prescription gives people easier access to a preventative medicine and allows them more choice about how they can protect their own health.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive how the success of community planning partnerships is measured.",
  "AnswerText": "At local level, Section 17 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 requires local authorities, as facilitators of the community planning process, to report regularly to their local communities on what community planning has achieved, including evidence of improved outcomes for service users. The overall intention of the act is to offer “trust within a framework”: it is for community planning partners to decide on local priorities and how their achievement should be measured and reported. Accordingly, Statutory Guidance makes clear that reports on community planning should be “geared towards the local community rather than the Executive”.</p> <p>At national level, the continuing programme of Audits of Best Value and Community Planning, performed by Audit Scotland on behalf of the Accounts Commission, provides an independent measure of the extent to which each council has fulfilled its “statutory duty to secure Best Value and to initiate and facilitate the Community Planning process”.</p><p>In addition, Audit Scotland is currently carrying out an extensive baseline review of community planning partnerships on behalf of the Accounts Commission and the Auditor General, for publication early in 2006. Audit Scotland describes the aim of the study as “to review the progress made by councils and partner organisations (including community and local voluntary groups) in developing Community Planning since the 2003 Local Government in Scotland Act came into force.”</p><p>Statutory Guidance on Community Planning was issued by Scottish ministers in April 2004 and is published at <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/localgov/cpsg-00.asp\">www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/localgov/cpsg-00.asp</a>.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what commitments it has received from rail freight companies to make use of enhanced gauging between Mossend and Elgin and how many additional rail journeys this will generate each year.",
  "AnswerText": "Without the gauge enhancement scheme, there is a risk that the existing freight traffic could be lost to road whilst the decision to progress allows for increased movement of freight by rail. This is a significant development for the north east of Scotland as it will deliver environmental and economical benefits, and it reaffirms the Scottish Executive’s commitment to a more efficient distribution of freight.</p> <p>Whilst it is not possible to gain commitments from the freight operating companies or their customers until the project is complete, detailed forecasting and marketing consultation has revealed a strong desire for the additional capacity and North East Scotland Rail Freight Development Group will be responsible for marketing and promoting the new facility with the aim of gaining optimum use.</p><p>Our forecasting cannot confirm the number of extra trains that will run, but it does indicate that the enhanced gauge will result in a reduction of lorry use by around 12.3 million vehicle kilometres per year.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Housing PolicyStatement published by the Executive in March emphasised our commitment to thebetter use of surplus public sector land for affordable housing. Thiscommitment is being taken forward in a number of ways.</p><p>Scottish Executive land thatis deemed surplus to requirements is notified internally to ExecutiveDepartments. Communities Scotland is notified through this process, and given theopportunity to register an interest in the land on behalf of registered socialLandlords (RSLs) who may wish to purchase the land for affordable housing. Additionally,we have announced a willingness to release land for affordable housing from the Scottish ministers’ estate, almost all of which is crofting land.</p><p>The Executive is workingwith other public bodies, including UK Government Departments, to developframework agreements with a view to securing transfers of surplus land foraffordable housing in areas where particular need has been identified.  Thisapproach has resulted in an agreement being reached with Forestry CommissionScotland who, in handling sales of surplus land, now provide a preferentialopportunity for RSLs to acquire the land for affordable housing. It is hopedthat similar agreements can be reached with other bodies in the near future. </p><p>Under the Local Government(Scotland) Act 1973, where a local authority proposes to dispose of land forless than the best that can be reasonably obtained, then consent must first begiven by the Scottish Ministers. This consent regime was amended by section 11of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 which provides that localauthorities can decide on their own proposals for the disposal of land at lessthan market price subject to the application of regulations and guidance issuedby ministers. Consultation on draft statutory guidance was undertaken earlierthis year and proposals for implementation are being developed.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Considerable progress has been made following the launch in February 2004 of this strategy, which identifies specific actions to conserve red squirrels in Scotland. These include addressing threats such as the effect of grey squirrels, changes to woodland habitats, the spread of disease and predation by other species upon the red squirrel population in Scotland. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) have published a report in which 127 priority woodlands for the conservation of the red squirrel have been identified across Scotland and squirrel friendly silviculture is being promoted through the Scottish Squirrel Group.</p> <p>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 amended the Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981 making the reckless destruction of the resting places of a schedule 5 listed species an offence. Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) has now the ability to attach conditions to felling licences to conserve the red squirrel and its habitat.</p><p>In August 2004 a Scottish Squirrel co-ordinator, based within the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT), was appointed by the Scottish Squirrel Group for a three year period. They will co-ordinate the existing records on the distribution of red and grey squirrels and allocate volunteer resources where required.</p><p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) have received applications from RSSS and the Ayrshire Red Squirrel Group for funding to employ part and full time squirrel workers.

Residents placed by local authorities would normally be liable to contribute to their care home fees although those with assets of under £19,500 would qualify for means-tested local authority funding. Those with higher capital may be eligible for free personal and nursing care support if they are aged 65 and over.</p><p>Both NHS MEL (1996) 22 and the Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland require that the individual is only discharged when an agreed care plan, support and accommodation are in place, available and properly resourced.</p>",

This will help to ensure that the need for land for development, including housing, is properly reflected in the development plan framework.</p> ",

The objective is to demonstrate that new residential areas can be designed with the needs of people uppermost and with reduced car dominance. The results of the research are twofold: a Planning Advice Note 76 New Residential Streets was published on 7 November, and the report of the research on Road Construction Consent was published on the Scottish Executive website on the same day. My officials conducted three presentations to stakeholders round Scotland in October, and are opening a debate on the way forward with local authority Heads of Planning and Chief Officers of Transportation.</p> ",

  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Executive issued detailed guidance to NHS boards on 1 November 2005 regarding the implementation of tariffs to 2005-06 cross boundary flows between NHS boards, i.e. activity carried out by host NHS boards on behalf of patients who reside in other NHS boards areas in Scotland.</p> <p>The guidance explains that tariffs will be phased in from the current financial year, 2005-06, to a selection of specific procedures (cardiac surgery and orthopaedics). The range of procedures to which the tariff will apply will be increased progressively over the next two financial years until it covers all tariff-based cross boundary flows. The introduction of tariffs will create an incentive for efficiency by encouraging benchmarking between boards and improve the accuracy of financial data by ensuring better recording of both costing and activity data.</p><p>NHS boards have been asked to agree financial flows for tariff based activity using the national tariff by the end of November 2005. Further guidance will be issued to NHS boards by the end of December regarding the increased application of tariffs for 2006-07.</p><p>A Tariff Reference Group with representation from NHS boards, the Health Department, and the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland, has been set up to assist with developing the tariff and will continue to monitor progress on implementation and explore options for the further development of the tariff.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Occupational and personal pensions are reserved matters under the Scotland Act 1998 and are the responsibility of the UK Government. However, Scottish ministers have the devolved responsibility for making regulations to establish and maintain public pensions schemes in Scotland, subject to the approval of HM Treasury. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) administers the Scottish Teachers and NHS Superannuation Schemes on the Scottish ministers’ behalf.</p> <p>Following the UK Government’s proposals in 2003 for public service pension reforms based on establishing a normal pension age of 65, the SPPA (in conjunction with unions and employers in Scotland) arranged public consultations on pension reform proposals for teachers and the NHS in Scotland. These consultations were completed in spring 2005. The SPPA, with other administrators of the public service pension schemes across the UK provided information to the UK Government on views and option costs following these consultations. The agency also attended meetings of the UK Public Services Forum in an observer capacity.</p><p>In taking forward the pension reform proposals in Scotland, the SPPA will now be discussing the implications of the agreed forum principles with representatives of teaching and NHS unions and employers and assessing the financial implications for each scheme. Further consultation is planned, once initial proposals have been agreed with unions and employers. The UK Government has already said that it expects the overall level of savings from increasing pension ages to be comparable to that previously assumed. The framework requires each scheme to work within a cost envelope which will be set out at an early stage of negotiations.</p>",

However, there is currently no compelling scientific evidence for the role of pollutants in breast-cancer risk. Evidence for a link between breast cancer and exposure to environmental pollutants is weak.</p> <p>Scottish Executive policy is designed to ensure that all pesticides are safe to those who use them, to consumers of the treated produce and to the environment. Monitoring programmes are run annually, including to identify residue levels of pesticides in crops, food and feeding stuffs.</p><p>The Scottish Executive supports the overall objective of the proposed new European Union’s Chemicals Strategy REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals), the aim of which is to protect human health and the environment. The Scottish and UK Governments want to develop a fast, efficient and workable process to test and screen chemicals and tackle those of most concern. It is hoped that the new regulatory regime will be a marked shift forward in terms of speeding up the regulation and authorisation process for new and existing chemicals.</p><p>Growth hormones are not permitted for feeding to animals in Scotland. The Feeding Stuffs (Scotland) Regulations 2000 will be replaced by The Feeding Stuffs (Scotland) 2005 Regulations. The new Regulations will ban the use of antibiotic growth promoters in Scotland from 1 January 2006.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Occupational and personal pensions are reserved matters under the Scotland Act 1998 and are the responsibility of the UK Government. However, Scottish ministers have the devolved responsibility for making regulations to establish and maintain public pensions schemes in Scotland, subject to the approval of HM Treasury.</p> <p>The Local Government Pension Schemes (LGPS) in England and Wales and Scotland are funded schemes with a normal pension age of 65. The UK Government’s proposals to reform these schemes are being taken forward through tripartite working groups involving Government, employers and the unions. The Scottish LGPS Group is due to meet on 17 November when the next steps in taking forward the reform of the LGPS will be discussed.</p><p>The Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) chairs the Scottish LGPS Group. In order to fulfil this role it liaises closely with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on issues relating to the LGPS as there is general policy aim of maintaining parity between each of the pension schemes across the UK to assist the potential for mobility and to ensure fairness. In addition, both the SPPA and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) regularly meet with other UK pension representatives at the UK Local Government Pensions Committee, ensuring that Scottish local government employers’ views are taken into account in this UK discussion forum.</p><p>The LGPS currently includes a provision through which certain members are able to retire on full pension at age 60, depending on their length of service and age. This provision will have to be removed in 2006 in order to comply with recent European age-discrimination legislation. However, protection for certain existing members who expected to qualify under this rule was proposed in a consultation paper on pension reforms issued by the SPPA in November 2004. These proposals will be discussed further by the LGPS Group.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Crime RecordingStandard was introduced in April 2004 and has been applied by all forces, includingGrampian. Figures collected by the Scottish Executive show that crime clear-up ratesfor Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray are below the Scottish average.</p><p>Grampian Police has traditionallycommitted significant resources to crime prevention and crime reduction as partof its approach to community policing and success in these areas is not always evidentin a singular performance indicator such as clear-up rates. For example, the numberoffences recorded per 10,000 population in Grampian is lower than the Scottish average.</p><p>That said, the force is not complacentand is currently undertaking a review of activities in support of detections.</p>",

The Scottish Executive and the United Kingdom Government’s position remains that, in relation to the Lockerbie trial, those tried and found guilty under Scottish law would serve their prison sentence in Scotland.</p><p>Given that the crime occurred in Scotland and that the trial and appeal were conducted under Scottish law, the Scottish Executive believes that it is appropriate that he serves his sentence here.</p>",

However, the subsidy usually takes the form of funding 100% of child care costs for the parent for a short, time-limited period only. It is then replaced by the child care element of Working Tax Credit which meets 70% of a parents’ childcare costs. The difference between receiving 70% of child care costs through Working Tax Credit and 100% of child care costs through subsidy, for the initial period on entering employment, can be crucial in supporting parents to sustain their employment at this important but often difficult transition period.</p> ",

Providers of care services regulated by the Care Commission under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 are required by regulations to ensure that their employees receive training appropriate to the work they are to perform and to give suitable assistance for the purpose of obtaining further qualifications appropriate to their work. The National Care Standards also provide further guidance on staff training requirements where appropriate.</p><p>The Scottish Social Services Council, established under the same act, is the regulatory body for the social service workforce. To register with the Council , workers will be required to meet conditions. These include meeting the qualifications criteria for the job they are doing, as set by the council. Registration of the workforce is being carried out in phases. The next groups of workers to be registered are managers of adult care homes and managers of adult day care services.

However, as explained in the answer to question S2W-20039 on 3 November 2005, the LGPS will have to be amended to remove the rule of 85 because legal advice is that the rule will not comply with European Equality legislation because of age discrimination. To comply, the rule will have to be removed from the Scheme, for existing as well as new members, by October 2006.</p> <p>The Scottish LGPS group will be discussing what degree of protection might be afforded to existing scheme members who would have qualified under the rule if it had not been removed. The discussions will continue over the next few months, with a view to agreed proposals being put to ministers by mid-2006.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p> <p>When compared with the level of efficiency for regular boilers required under the current Scottish building regulations, installation of condensing boilers as direct replacements can be difficult to justify in terms of cost-effectiveness or energy-efficiency alone.</p><p>Condensing boilers, however, can make significant savings in terms of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and consequently consideration is being given to introducing them into Scottish building regulations as a part of the current review. They would not be made mandatory in all new heating systems as this would disadvantage other emerging energy-efficient technology such as heat-pumps, but could be one way of meeting the energy standard for heating systems. This review will be out to public consultation in early 2006 with subsequent changes being brought into effect in spring 2007.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p> <p>Since the programme started in 2001, a total 33,992 non-condensing boilers have been installed. At this stage the types of boilers to be used in any successor programme have yet to be decided, and as such it is not possible to say if any non-condensing boilers would be installed between now and May 2007. It is estimated that if condensing boilers had been used in the programme to date, the additional cost (based on current prices) would be in the region of £8.5 million.</p><p>It is estimated that the average annual savings resulting in using condensing as opposed to non-condensing boilers would range between £19 for a flat to £41 for a detached property. It is estimated that there would be a 10% reduction in energy consumption but there will be wide variations in both price and energy savings as a result of climate, exposure, occupancy patterns, heating controls, insulation and other factors.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "All officers in the Scottish Fingerprint Service (SFS) carry out their work in line with international standards. They all agree that fingerprint evidence is expert opinion of identification based on the scientific fact that fingerprints are unique to every individual and that an identification is made when the expert is personally satisfied that the order, relationship and unique properties of the features in any two prints are in agreement with no features in disagreement which cannot be explained. Once a match has been made it must be verified by two other fingerprint officers.</p> <p>The processes are subject to internal quality assurance and to external independent audit under ISO 9001:2000 to which the SFS is accredited.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what the rate of (a) hepatitis A, (b) hepatitis B and (c) non-A, non-B hepatitis resulting from whole blood exposure was in each year from 1965 to 1992.",
  "AnswerText": "Data does not exist in the form requested for a number of reasons. This information was held, until about 1991, in regional transfusion centres (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness) and not pooled, and SNBTS does not have the records for these years. Estimates can be made based on the results of tests when these became available. These rely on the incidence of infections in the community (number of new cases), the prevalence (total number of cases) and the “window period” of the test. This window period is that time from a person becoming infected until the test is positive. Information on the number of transmissions in relation to each of the type of hepatitis is as follows.</p> <p>No data is available for the period prior<b> </b>to 1978 on hepatitis A. Transfusion-transmitted hepatitis A is extremely rare with only two cases reported in the UK over the past 20 years.</p><p> Tests for hepatitis B were only available from 1971. Transfusion- transmitted hepatitis B infection was quite common prior to the introduction of donor HBsAg screening around 1971, following which the reported number of cases fell to around five cases per annum for Scotland. Since 1991, this has dropped further and current UK residual risk is around 1:500,000 donations. For non-A non-B hepatitis –shown to be hepatitis C from around 1990-transfusion-associated hepatitis would only be a proportion of the actual rate of infection in recipients. It has been estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 people were infected in the United Kingdom in the 10 years prior to 1991, equating to between 700 and 1500 in Scotland, or some 70-150 each year. The current residual risk of hepatitis C is now estimated to be around one in 10 million donations and at this rate it could be expected that Scotland would experience one hepatitis C transmission every 40 years.</p>",

The actual nature and method of the response may of course vary depending on the local circumstances. For Aberdeen City, aside from the local authority’s mainstream programmes, the main funds currently available are:</p><p>The Community Regeneration Fund (CRF) - Aberdeen</p><p>The funding from the Scottish Executive’s Community Regeneration Fund is specifically targeted at the most deprived areas of the city - supporting services and projects which improve people’s lives and the places they live. </p><p>For the period between 2005-06 and 2007-08 the Scottish Executive has allocated £3.726 million through the Community Regeneration Fund to the Aberdeen City. This fund is managed by Aberdeen City’s Community Planning Partnership (The Aberdeen City Alliance), and its key investment priorities are set out in their Regeneration Outcome Agreement which the Minister for Communities approved on 2 September 2005. This fund provides the partnership with the scope to allocate resources to a broad range of community supported projects, including where considered appropriate, projects like the one at Castlemilk,  that are tailored to help and support the needs of our young people within their communities.</p><p>Wider Role - Aberdeen</p><p>A fund managed, supported and allocated by Communities Scotland area teams around the country. The funds are only available to registered social landlords or to voluntary organisations that are specifically supporting registered social landlords’ wider role activity.</p><p>The Communities Scotland Aberdeen office currently has an annual allocation of around £0.6 million. Since 1998 Communities Scotland has provided financial support to the value of £1.3 million to the Aberdeen Foyer, - through their sponsoring registered social landlord Grampian Housing Association. </p><p>The Aberdeen Foyer is a successful local charitable organisation working with young people to prevent and alleviate youth homelessness and unemployment. In addition, they provide accommodation and access to wide range of educational, training, employment and community health services for young people. This project is now in its tenth year and has a turnover of close on £3.5 million This year Communities Scotland is providing around £0.29 million to help support five of the Aberdeen Foyer projects.</p><p>Communities Scotland have also given financial support to help the Torry Youth Café to expand their services for the young people in the Torry area of Aberdeen.</p><p>In addition they are providing partnership investment funding alongside Aberdeen City Council and Scottish Enterprise Grampian to support the three Opportunity Gateway Houses in Aberdeen, and they place significant emphasis on the need to support and develop the younger people within our communities.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what research has been carried out into the effectiveness of suspension of the right of local authorities to require proof of a local connection in allocating housing.",
  "AnswerText": "Local authorities and registered social landlords are legislatively required to open their housing list to all residents in their area who are aged over 16 and to those who wish to move to the area for employment, medical or social reasons or because they are suffering from harassment or risk of domestic abuse. Guidance makes clear that applicants for housing should not be debarred because they have no local connection with an area, although local connection might be a factor in determining priority. No research on this specific aspect of allocations has been carried out.</p> <p>Local connection is taken into account in homelessness legislation. Certain homeless households who do not have a local connection with the local authority to whom they have applied may be referred to another authority where they do have such a connection. The Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 allows for the modification of the local connection provisions and research has been carried out to inform these changes - which have not yet taken place. This research, <i>Operation of Power to Modify Local Connection Provisions, </i>was published earlier this year and is available on the Scottish Executive’s website. Consultation on modifying the local connection provisions in homelessness legislation will take place in 2006.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that ancient woodlands are central to policies on planning, woodland and forestry.",
  "AnswerText": "National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 14: <i>Natural Heritage</i> notes that planning authorities should seek to protect trees, groups of trees and areas of woodland where they have natural heritage value or contribute to the character or amenity of a particular locality. The policies contained in NPPGs are material considerations to be taken into account in development plan preparation and development control.</p> <p>The protection, enhancement and expansion of ancient and native woodland are key priorities under the current Scottish Forestry Strategy. Feed-back from public consultation on the review of the strategy confirms there is strong support for these priorities, and we are now considering how to develop them in the draft revised strategy which will be issued for consultation in February. To help identify target areas, a Scottish Native Woodlands Survey project is currently being piloted by Forestry Commission Scotland which aims to create a comprehensive map and database on the extent, type and condition of native woodland, including ancient native woodland. Also, the commission leads the Native Woodland Partnership for Scotland, a body comprising representatives from government, owners’ associations, professional bodies and Non-Governmental Organisations. The partnership leads the implementation of native woodland habitat action plans, whilst advising on relevant policies, best practice and research. It is currently developing proposed habitat action plan targets which will be considered as part of the strategy review process.</p>",

  "AnswerText": "Should Caledonian MacBrayne proceed and implement their offshore crewing proposals prior to the start of the new contract this will have no impact on the security of employment for the Caledonian MacBrayne workforce. The Invitation to Tender will invite bids on the basis that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) applies and the staff will transfer, should another operator win the contract. Recent case law strengthens the view that TUPE will apply. In addition, offshore status will not affect the more general protection available to employees under UK employment law. Employees would continue to be employed within the UK and on UK flagged vessels. As such they would continue to have the same statutory rights they currently enjoy in relation to their employment.</p> ",

  "AnswerText": "As highlighted in the reportfrom the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland earlierthis year, there are a number of financial support mechanisms for biomass plantand bio-energy schemes. These include the Department of Trade and Industry’s Bio-EnergyCapital Grants Scheme, which will part-fund the planned new biomass electricityplant at Lockerbie. The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative,which is sponsored by the Scottish Executive and managed jointly by the Energy SavingsTrust and Highlands and Islands Enterprise has funded over 30 biomass related projectsto date. Also, the Highlands and Islands Woodfuel Development programme, funded bya partnership including Forestry Commission Scotland and Highlands andIslands Enterprise, can provide capital grants for boiler installation.</p><p>We remain committed to the provisionof support for biomass and we are currently considering ways in which we might supportand accelerate a range of renewables developments, including biomass heat and power.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with, and what representations it has made to, HM Treasury in relation to the proposed replacement of contributions under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 with a planning gain supplement.",
  "AnswerText": "Following publication of the Barker Review of Housing Supply in March 2004, which contained a recommendation for a planning gain supplement, Scottish Executive officials discussed the general principles with HM Treasury and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister officials. In the course of general discussions with UK ministers, I have reminded them of the need to consider the implications for devolved administrations when developing the detailed proposals. The First Minister repeated the importance of carefully considering the implications for Scotland when HM Treasury informed us, prior to the Chancellor’s Pre-Budget Report, that it would consult on detailed proposals for a planning gain supplement. We will therefore consider these proposals in depth before making any specific representations on the details themselves to HM Treasury.</p> <p>The consultation paper does <u>not</u> propose the replacement of contributions under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. The paper indicates that the UK Government will act to scale back, but not remove, the scope of planning obligations under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which applies to England and Wales only. As planning is a devolved matter, it will be for Scottish ministers to decide whether to propose any change to the system of planning agreements, currently provided for under section 75 of Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>",

In recent years, many buyers have profited from home ownership, due to house price rises, which have allowed personal wealth to increase for many. Those in poverty, however, may be unable to buy their home through the right to buy, because they are required to raise the remainder of the purchase price themselves, whether by using savings or through a mortgage.</p> <p>The Executive recognises that renting is just as valid a choice of tenure as home ownership.

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will take separate legal advice with regard to the abolition of Rule 85 of the local government pension scheme, in light of conflicting legal advice reported by the UK Government, COSLA and UNISON.",
  "AnswerText": "The Scottish Executive consulted on proposals for the amendment of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland in September 2004. The proposals were intended to deal with the sustainability and affordability of the scheme as part of the on-going development of the LGPS and also to ensure that the scheme complied with EC Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.</p> <p>The Rule of 85 allows members of the LGPS to access full pension if they leave employment at age 60 or more but before the scheme’s normal retirement age of 65, if their age and length of service (including any period since leaving local government employment) total at least 85.</p><p>The Minister for Local Government in England and Wales announced, on 2 December 2005, that the UK Government had concluded that the Rule of 85 is to be removed from 1 October 2006 by amendments to the scheme regulations in England and Wales. The announcement stated that this was necessary in order to implement the terms of the EC Directive.</p><p>The Scottish Executive has given careful consideration to the legal opinion presented by COSLA on the question of the removal of the Rule of 85 from the Local Government Pension Scheme in Scotland and also that presented to the UK Government by UNISON. The Executive has concluded that retaining the rule would be incompatible with the Directive on age discrimination and that therefore it will require to be removed from the Local Government Pension Scheme with effect from October this year, in accordance with the UK Government’s timetable for implementing the Directive.</p><p>The Executive therefore intends that the Rule of 85 will be removed with effect from 1 October 2006 by amending the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 1998 in order to ensure compliance with the EC Directive and help maintain the sustainability and affordability of the Scottish scheme. Where it can be objectively justified consideration will be given to providing transitional protection to those existing scheme members who might have qualified to receive an unreduced early pension under the rule if it was not removed, and who may not have sufficient time to make alternative savings plans for their retirement. As was set out in the Executive’s consultation paper in September 2004, it is proposed that protection be provided to those existing scheme members who would satisfy the current Rule of 85 and attain age 60 by 31 March 2013. However, during the period of consultation the Executive will wish to discuss such proposals further with representatives of the local employers and unions representing LGPS members.</p><p>The Executive will prepare draft Regulations to implement the removal of the rule and publish these for consultation shortly.</p>",

In consultation with the Scottish Executive, it was agreed that they, andtie Ltd the promoters of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, should utilise the Parliamentssummer recess (2005) to:</p><p>consult further with the PrivateBills Unit (PBU);</p><p>await the report from the WaverleyRailway (Scotland) Bill Committee, and thereby</p><p>ensure that they had learnedfrom the experiences of previously submitted transportation legislation in draftingthe GARL Bill and accompanying documentation, thereby making the most efficientuse of the Parliament’s time and resources.</p><p>Subsequently the Parliament’sProcedures Committee was minded to consider changes to the Private Bills processwhich would allow the appointment of an Inquiry Reporter to hear the detailed objectionsat the Consideration stage. It was therefore agreed that the Private Bills for theairport rail links should not be submitted until the committee was in a positionto finalise its consideration and recommendation to Parliament.</p><p>Transport Scotland hasincurred no additional cost as a result of this, as the projected end date for theGARL project remains unchanged.</p><p>SPT have advised that they haveapproved an additional £350,000, or 10% of the previously advised costs for thedevelopment of the GARL project and subsequent support through the Parliamentaryprocess. The additional costs are as a result of one) the additional work undertakenby SPT and their consultants over the summer recess in consulting with the PBU,and subsequent revision to the Bill and accompanying documentation, and two) tocomply with the Presiding Officers determination with regard to consulting withScottish National Heritage, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and HistoricScotland in respect of the projects Environmental Statement.</p><p>Transport Scotland hasthe operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more informationif required.</p>",

It is more likely that existing construction and property professionals will subsume the work created by the directive as a supplementary part of their existing business. The result of this could be that more persons embark on a career in property and construction. In view of this, reliable quantification of new property and construction professionals is near impossible as this will depend on how much directive work is subsumed by each business.</p>",

The profiles of the NHS non-salaried and salaried general dental services are significantly different and, due to the types of service provided by salaried dentists, registration figures are not comparable. Many salaried dentists provide an access only service, either full or part of the time, and do not therefore register patients or register only a small number of patients. In addition, senior and specialist salaried dentists may not register patients due to the type of service they provide. Consequently, salaried dentists with fewer than 100 registered patients at 31 March 2005 have been excluded.</p>",

It has developed a raft of measures, based on evidence and best practice, including surveillance, professional guidance, education and training programmes, and clear reporting and accountability structures. For example, guidance on the prudent use of antibiotics, which is one of the main factors in controlling <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, issued in September 2005.</p><p>This year, the task force will begin a new programme of work to ensure these measures are firmly embedded into every day practice in health care settings across Scotland. It will also oversee further developments to tackle HAI. As part of this new programme of work, we are enhancing monitoring and surveillance measures, and it will be mandatory for NHS laboratories to report all cases of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> from April 2006.</p>",

A new training course for line managers, intended to develop effective management techniques for dealing with managing attendance, is in its final design stage.</p><p>Resolution strategies for all long-term sick cases have been developed, resulting so far in the return to work of a third of the cases approached, with some others leaving the organisation through resignation, dismissal or medical retirement. This work is on-going.</p><p>These measures together with a variety of flexible working practices are aimed at reducing sick absence and assisting staff to return to work as quickly as possible.</p>",

  "ItemText": "To ask the Scottish Executive what support and assistance is provided through its agencies and non-departmental public bodies to help migrant workers learn English language skills.",
  "AnswerText": "Publicly-funded English language classes for immigrants, including migrant workers, are provided in further education (FE) colleges, community learning and development (CLD) partnerships and adult literacy and numeracy (ALN) partnerships, and by a small number of voluntary providers. Disaggregated data on the support for English language classes for migrant workers, as distinct from other provision, are not available because of the way that these various bodies are funded.</p> <p>However, the Scottish Executive has taken substantial action in recent years to facilitate the provision of English language classes. Between 2001 and 2004 an extra £5.4 million was allocated to the FE sector to ensure that colleges boost provision. From 2004-05, this resource has been mainstreamed into FE baseline funding. This funding has helped to expand considerably the provision of English language classes and reduce waiting lists for lessons.</p><p>While we do currently allocate considerable resources for provision of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) in Scotland, we recognise the need for a clear strategy in this area. Public consultation on the formulation of a national adult ESOL strategy for Scotland ended on 31 October 2005. Detailed analysis of the consultation responses, which indicate broad agreement with the vision and guiding principles for the strategy, is currently being completed, and we plan to launch our adult ESOL strategy this spring.</p>",
