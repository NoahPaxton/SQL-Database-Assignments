At their request , we immediatelyseconded 11 Scottish Executive staff to meet an urgent need for administrativeassistance at the British Red Cross, SCIAF and Mercy Corp. We also co-ordinatedadvertisements for the Scottish Emergency Appeal, which appeared in a range ofScottish papers. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer’s team has co-ordinated Scottish offers of specialist medical help to the World Health Organisation, including the option to second Scottish Executive specialist medical personnel. Ten Scottish police officers have been deployed in support of the Metropolitan Police casualty bureau.</p><p>The First Minister indicated to the Parliament on 12 January that the Scottish Executive is committed to assisting the longer term reconstruction effort, as the assessment of need in the affected region becomes clearer. The Scottish Executive has maintained a dialogue with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Departmentfor International Development and public services in Scotland to facilitate assistance from public services to the areas affected by the tsunami. We are in discussion with Scottish based international aid agencies and public service organisations about how this can be taken forward.</p>",

Although it would be possible to continue to work tothe original timetable, in my view the risk of slippage of key elements is now suchas to make it prudent to announce a short delay to commencement. Making this decisionnow will give service users, carers, professionals and managers confidence thateach of the elements necessary for successful implementation will be in place whenthe act comes into force and enable them to plan effectively for the new commencementdate which will be in October of this year.
